<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
    "Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven 
    cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago 
    marking the beginning of the modern climate era — and of human civilization. 
    Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth’s orbit that change 
    the amount of solar energy our planet receives.
</p>
<p>
    The current warming trend is of particular significance because it is unequivocally the result of 
    human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over millennia. 
    It is undeniable that human activities have warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land and that widespread 
    and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred."

    <h1 class="Title">Causes of Global Warming</h1>
    <p>
        Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the "greenhouse effect" — 
        warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space. Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. 
        Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as "forcing" 
        climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as "feedbacks."
        Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:
    </p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><b>Water vapour</b> - The most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as a feedback to the climate. 
                Water vapor increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation, 
                making these some of the most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.</li>

            <li><b>Carbon dioxide</b> - A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released 
                through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, 
                land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by 48% since the Industrial 
                Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived "forcing" of climate change.</li>

            <li><b>Methane</b> - A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human activities, including the decomposition of wastes 
                in landfills, agriculture, and especially rice cultivation, as well as ruminant digestion and manure management associated 
                with domestic livestock. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, methane is a far more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, 
                but also one which is much less abundant in the atmosphere.</li>

            <li><b>Nitrous oxide</b> -  A powerful greenhouse gas produced by soil cultivation practices, especially the use of commercial and organic 
                fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning.</li>

            <li><b>Chlorofluorocarbons</b> - Synthetic compounds entirely of industrial origin used in a number of applications, but now largely 
                regulated in production and release to the atmosphere by international agreement for their ability to contribute to destruction 
                of the ozone layer. They are also greenhouse gases.</li>

        </ul>
    <p>
        On Earth, human activities are changing the natural greenhouse. Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased 
        the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air 
        to make CO2. To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.

<h1 class="Title">How It Affects Our Planet</h1>
<p>
    Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. 
    Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner. 
    Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level 
    rise and longer, more intense heat waves. 
<p>
    Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for 
    decades to come, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which 
    includes more than 1,300 scientists from the United States and other countries, forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.
</p> 
<p>
    According to the IPCC, the extent of climate change effects on individual regions will vary over time and with the ability of different societal and 
    environmental systems to mitigate or adapt to change. The IPCC predicts that increases in global mean temperature of less than 1.8 to 5.4 degrees 
    Fahrenheit (1 to 3 degrees Celsius) above 1990 levels will produce beneficial impacts in some regions and harmful ones in others. Net annual costs will 
    increase over time as global temperatures increase.

<h1 class="Title">Evidence that Climate Change is Real</h1>
<p>
    Earth-orbiting satellites and other technological advances have enabled scientists to see the big picture, collecting many different types of 
    information about our planet and its climate on a global scale. This body of data, collected over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate.
</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li><b>Global temperature rise</b> - The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2.12 degrees Fahrenheit (1.18 degrees Celsius) 
        since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the 
        atmosphere and other human activities. Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the 
        seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.
    </li>
    <li><b>Warming oceans</b> - The ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters 
        (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of more than 0.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969. Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean.

    </li>
    <li><b>Shrinking ice sheets</b> - The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity 
        Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, 
        while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.

    </li>
    <li><b>Glacial retreat</b> - Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world — including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.

    </li>
    <li><b>Decreased snow cover</b> - Satellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has 
        decreased over the past five decades and the snow is melting earlier.

    </li>
    <li><b>Sea level rise</b> - Global sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, 
        however, is nearly double that of the last century and accelerating slightly every year.

    </li>
    <li><b>Declining Arctic sea level</b> - Both the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly over the last several decades.

    </li>
    <li><b>Extreme Events</b> - The number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature 
        events has been decreasing, since 1950. The U.S. has also witnessed increasing numbers of intense rainfall events.

    </li>
    <li><b>Ocean acidification</b> - Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 
        30%. This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the ocean. 
        The ocean has absorbed between 20% and 30% of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions in recent decades (7.2 to 10.8 billion metric tons per year).
